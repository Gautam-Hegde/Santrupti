# Inspiration
			          
After an event, a lot of food is wasted, and many people don't eat two square meals every day. Volunteers are accessible. A platform is needed to connect wedding/party halls and individuals to nearby locations where this food can be distributed to those in need while minimizing food waste. Many of India's poor and downtrodden people lack proper attire. Donating clothes not only improves the lives of the poor, but it also promotes the environmentally good concept of recycling.Â 


## What it does
A website that connects wedding/party halls and individuals to the nearest locations where this food can be distributed to those in need.

## How we built it
We used reactjs and tailwind css for frontend likewise solidity ,hardhat,moralis for backend

## Challenges we ran into
We had to learn the working of smart contracts and how web3 actually works.
Using Moralis to implement the Web3 infrastructure.
A robust design to encompass the whole idea of the platform.
Thinking of a strong logistic strategy to get people to the food and not let it go to waste

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that this is our first online hackathon we are participating
We are proud of the way we worked together as a team and built this project
We are proud of the way we kept motivating ourselves and our teammates at times where our project's progress was stagnant

## What we learned
We learned the whole concept of blockchain which will rule the sector of webapps in future
## What's next for Santrupti
We are trying to build a secure funding platform for the donors to ensure that all of their money reaches the right cause.


use `npm i --force` to install all the dependencies required for the webapp to run on the locahost.
